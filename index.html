        "I saw The Driving Crooner on the 110 just outside LA!  It was the coolest thing that I have ever seen.  I almost had to step in though when I 
        saw some stupid frat guy speed up to try to make it look fake.  I don't know why they hate it so much!  It doesn't make any sense.  The Driving Crooner was born to
        do this, he was born to be GREAT.  I am so glad that he found a way to make money off of this idea, it is simply too good.  5/5 Cigars!"
