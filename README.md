# odin-landing-page
This repo is for the Landing Page project for The Odin Project.

The intent of this project is to build a website from scratch with an image provided by The Odin Project for direction.  I will create all the files that are necessary for this project and will not be working off a template.

Goals:
  - I want to internalize everything that I have learned in the HTML and CSS lessons that I have take so far.
  - I want to finish this project without looking at any completed code examples.  If I feel stuck on something, I want to analyze the problem and then determine how to solve it myself using Google.
  - I want to add some personality to it, just to flex those muscles a little bit, but I do not need to get bogged down or discouraged by any aesthetic problems.
